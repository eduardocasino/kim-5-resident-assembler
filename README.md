## KIM-5 Resident Assembler CA65 sources and utilities

### Contents

The `assembler` folder contains the sources of the KIM-5 Resident Assembler in CA65 format. They are adapted from Hans Otten's recently published sources in TASM32 format.

In the `utils` folder, a couple of utilities to import/export assembly sources between the KIM-5 assembler/editor and a PC

Finally, the `examples` folder contains the files referenced [in this post at my blog](https://eduardocasino.es/posts/The-KIM-5-Resident-Assembler).
